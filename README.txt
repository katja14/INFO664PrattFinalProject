Project: Using web scraping, I grabbed information from libraries across the country and then wrote a script to find out how many of them use social media, as well as what social media sites they use specifically. My goal was to learn more about library outreach practices and how they vary by state. Social media outreach is a valuable way for cultural institutions to reach their communities and increase the visibility and accessibility of their institution. 

My process: First, I wrote a Python script (library_scrape.py) to scrape the state pages linked on https://librarytechnology.org/libraries/uspublic/. Those were dumped into a .json file (all_libraries.json). Each state page lists the links to the libraries' websites, so I then wrote another script (library_social.py) to scrape each of the library websites listed in the .json file to check whether they contained social media links, then dump the links along with some basic information about each library into another .json file (all_libraries_with_sites.json). Some of the websites were unable to be scraped, so there’s also a spot for ‘connection_error” to indicate if that was an issue. I then wrote a script (processing.py) using the pandas module to pull out the number of libraries that use each social media network, by state. I was having trouble with the import — I kept getting an error from terminal when I tried to run the script from the .py file that I made in my text editor. Even though I pip installed pandas, and wrote import pandas at the top of the script, I kept getting the error that I didn’t have pandas installed even though it would then show where it was when I tried to install it again. Anyway, I ended up having to run the script in a python shell by copy and pasting each line directly in because it was the only way I could get it to work. I then saved the data as a .txt (process_json.txt) since I couldn’t do a .json dump (or maybe I could have? Too late now…) and from there, I manually entered the data from process_json into Google Sheets. I also used google sheets to calculate the percentages, then used the data to make some charts and graphs. I only wish that I could’ve gotten the number of libraries in each state that use social media at all; I wasn’t able to figure out how to get that number.
